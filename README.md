# 🧠 CyberNotes — Fullstack Note-Taking Web Application

## 📌 About the Project
CyberNotes is a pet project developed from scratch by me. It is a fully functional application for creating, storing, and searching both public and private notes. Modern technologies are used both on the backend and frontend.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend:
- Java 21, Spring Boot (Web, Security, Data JPA)
- Liquibase, PostgreSQL
- Docker
- JUnit, Mockito, Testcontainers

### Frontend:
- React + Vite
- TypeScript
- React Router
- LESS
- Nginx (production)

### DevOps:
- Docker Compose
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Deployment on VPS

## 🚀 Features
- User registration and login with session-based authentication
- CRUD operations for notes (private and public)
- Viewing other users’ public notes
- REST API with filtering and pagination
- Clear separation between backend and frontend
- CI/CD pipeline and deployment (nginx + Docker)
